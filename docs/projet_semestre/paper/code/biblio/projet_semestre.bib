	abstract = {Using passwords for user authentication is still the most common method for many internet services and attacks on the password databases pose a severe threat. To reduce this risk, servers store password hashes, which were generated using special password-hashing functions, to slow down guessing attacks. The most frequently used functions of this type are PBKDF2, bcrypt and scrypt. In this paper, we present a novel, flexible, high-speed implementation of a bcrypt password search system on a low-power Xilinx Zynq 7020 FPGA. The design consists of 40 parallel bcrypt cores running at 100 MHz. Our implementation outperforms all currently available implementations and improves password attacks on the same platform by at least 42\%, computing 6,511 passwords per second for a cost parameter of 5.},

	abstract = {bcrypt is a password-hashing function designed by Niels Provos and David Mazi√®res, based on the Blowfish cipher and presented at USENIX in 1999. Besides incorporating a salt to protect against rainbow table attacks, bcrypt is an adaptive function: over time, the iteration count can be increased to make it slower, so it remains resistant to brute-force search attacks even with increasing computation power.
The bcrypt function is the default password hash algorithm for OpenBSD, and was the default for some Linux distributions such as SUSE Linux.There are implementations of bcrypt in C, C++, C\#, Embarcadero Delphi, Elixir, Go, Java, JavaScript, Perl, PHP, Ruby, and other languages.},

	abstract = {FPGA implementation of MD5 hash algorithm is faster than its software counterpart, but a pre-image brute-force attack on MD5 hash still needs 2{\textasciicircum}(128) iterations theoretically. This work attempts to improve the speed of the brute-force attack on the MD5 algorithm using hardware implementation. A full 64-stage pipelining is done for MD5 hash generation and three architectures are presented for guess password generation. A 32/34/26-instance parallelization of MD5 hash generator and password generator pair is done to search for a password that was hashed using the MD5 algorithm. Total performance of about 6G trials/second has been achieved using a single Virtex-7 FPGA device.},
